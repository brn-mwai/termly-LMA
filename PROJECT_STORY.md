## The Problem We're Solving

Every quarter, credit teams at banks and lending institutions face the same challenge: monitoring whether borrowers are meeting their loan covenant obligations.

Today, this process is manual:

1. Collect financial statements and compliance certificates from borrowers
2. Open 100-300 page credit agreements to find covenant definitions
3. Extract financial data by hand into spreadsheets
4. Calculate ratios (leverage, interest coverage, fixed charge coverage)
5. Compare results against covenant thresholds
6. Flag breaches and generate reports

**This takes 5-11 hours per loan, every testing period.**

The consequences are significant:

- **Delayed breach detection** — Problems are discovered weeks after they occur
- **Human error** — Studies show 9 out of 10 spreadsheets contain formula errors
- **Scaling challenges** — More loans means more analysts, not more efficiency
- **Missed obligations** — 38% of middle-market companies unknowingly violate covenants

## Our Solution

**Termly automates covenant monitoring from document to dashboard.**

Upload a loan document. Our AI extracts the covenants, calculates compliance, and alerts you to breaches—in minutes, not hours.

## Commercial Viability

### Value Proposition

**For lenders**: Reduce covenant monitoring time by 95%. Catch breaches before they become defaults.

**For borrowers**: Faster, more accurate compliance verification. Fewer back-and-forth requests.

### Efficiency Gains

| Metric | Manual Process | With Termly | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Time per loan | 5-11 hours | ~5 minutes | **98% reduction** |
| Document extraction | 2-4 hours | 60 seconds | **99% faster** |
| Breach detection | Weeks delayed | Real-time | **Immediate** |
| Error rate | 1-10% | ~1% | **Up to 90% fewer errors** |

**Example**: A portfolio of 200 loans tested quarterly
- Before: 1,000-2,200 hours per quarter (~$100,000-$200,000 in analyst time)
- After: ~17 hours per quarter
- **Annual savings: $400,000-$800,000**

### Scalability Potential

- **Multi-tenant architecture** — Supports multiple organisations on one platform
- **Cloud-native deployment** — Scales automatically with demand
- **API-ready** — Can integrate with existing loan management systems
- **No per-seat limits** — Pricing based on portfolio size, not headcount

### Potential Impact

- **$5.5 trillion** combined loan market (syndicated + private credit)
- **$3.7 billion** loan compliance monitoring market (2024), growing to **$17.5 billion** by 2034
- **130-225 CLO managers** globally requiring continuous covenant surveillance
- Addresses a process that hasn't fundamentally changed in decades
